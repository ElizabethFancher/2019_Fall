This is my file. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My file is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My file, without me, is useless. Without my file, I am useless. I must fire my file true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will... My file and myself know that what counts in this war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit... My file is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will ever guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, my eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my file clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will... Before God, I swear this creed. My file and myself are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life. So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace!
